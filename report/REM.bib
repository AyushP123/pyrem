	abstract = {Some animals never exhibit a state that meets the behavioral definition of sleep. Others suspend or greatly reduce ‘sleep’ behavior for many weeks during the postpartum period or during seasonal migrations without any consequent ‘sleep debt.’ Rats die from one form of sleep deprivation, but sleep loss has not been shown to cause death in well-controlled studies in other vertebrate species. Some marine mammal species do not show evidence for {REM} sleep, and convincing evidence for this state in reptiles, fish and insects is lacking. The enormous variation in the nature of rest and sleep states across the animal kingdom and within the mammalian class has important implications for understanding the evolution and functions of sleep.},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in {ENSO} variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

Sleep spindles are used for the classification of sleep stages and have been studied in the context of various psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and the so-called Mild Cognitive Impairment ({MCI}), which is considered to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. The visual processing of whole-night sleep {EEG} recordings is tedious. Therefore, various techniques have been proposed for automatically detecting sleep spindles. In the present work an automatic sleep spindle detection system, that has been previously proposed, using a Multi-Layer Perceptron ({MLP}) Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}), is evaluated in detecting spindles of both healthy controls, as well as {MCI} and {AD} patients. An investigation is carried also concerning the visual detection process, taking into consideration the feedback information provided by the automatic detection system. Results indicate that the sensitivity of the detector was 81.4\%, 62.2\%, and 83.3\% and the false positive rate was 34\%, 11.5\%, and 33.3\%, for the control, {MCI}, and {AD} groups, respectively.

This study aims to identify a method which would classify sleep stages automatically and with a high degree of accuracy and, in this manner, will assist sleep experts. This study consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature selection from {EEG} signals, and classification of these signals. In the feature extraction stage, it is used 20 attribute algorithms in four categories. 41 feature parameters were obtained from these algorithms. Feature selection is important in the elimination of irrelevant and redundant features and in this manner prediction accuracy is improved and computational overhead in classification is reduced. Effective feature selection algorithms such as minimum redundancy maximum relevance ({mRMR}); fast correlation based feature selection ({FCBF}); {ReliefF}; t-test; and Fisher score algorithms are preferred at the feature selection stage in selecting a set of features which best represent {EEG} signals. The features obtained are used as input parameters for the classification algorithms. At the classification stage, five different classification algorithms (random forest ({RF}); feed-forward neural network ({FFNN}); decision tree ({DT}); support vector machine ({SVM}); and radial basis function neural network ({RBF})) classify the problem. The results, obtained from different classification algorithms, are provided so that a comparison can be made between computation times and accuracy rates. Finally, it is obtained 97.03 \% classification accuracy using the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method indicate the ability to design a new intelligent assistance sleep scoring system.},

The purposes of this work are to automatic score the sleep stages and to help to sleep physicians on sleep stage scoring. In this work, a novel data preprocessing method called k-means clustering based feature weighting ({KMCFW}) has been proposed and combined with k-{NN} (k-nearest neighbor) and decision tree classifiers to classify the {EEG} (electroencephalogram) sleep into six sleep stages including awake, N-{REM} (non-rapid eye movement) stage 1, N-{REM} stage 2, N-{REM} stage 3, {REM}, and non-sleep (movement time). First of all, frequency domain features belonging to sleep {EEG} signal have been extracted using Welch spectral analysis method and composed 129 features from {EEG} signal relating each sleep stages. In order to decrease the features, the statistical features comprising minimum value, maximum value, standard deviation, and mean value have been used and then reduced from 129 to 4 features. In the second phase, the sleep stages dataset with four features has been weighted by means of k-means clustering based feature weighting. Finally, the weighted sleep stages have been automatically classified into six sleep stages using k-{NN} and C4.5 decision tree classifier. In the classification of sleep stages, the k values of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 in k-{NN} classifier have been used and compared with each other. In the experimental results, while sleep stages has been classified with 55.88\% success rate using k-{NN} classifier (for k value of 40), the weighted sleep stages with {KMCFW} has been recognized with 82.15\% success rate k-{NN} classifier (for k value of 40). And also, we have investigated the relevance between sleep stages and frequency domain features belonging to {EEG} signal. These results have demonstrated that proposed weighting method have a considerable impact on automatic determining of sleep stages. This system could be used as an online system in the automatic scoring of sleep stages and helps to sleep physicians in the sleep scoring process.},

Two experts scored retrospective data obtained from six Sprague–Dawley rodents to provide the training sets and subsequent comparison data used to assess the effectiveness of the {SVM}. Numerous time-domain and frequency-domain features were extracted for each epoch and selectively reduced using statistical analyses. The {SVM} kernel function was chosen to be a Gaussian radial basis function and kernel parameters were varied to examine the effectiveness of optimization methods.

In recent years, much effort has been made to develop computerized methods which can characterize different interictal, ictal and postictal stages. The main issue of whether there exist a preictal phenomenon is unresolved. In this paper, we address this issue making use of the most basic representation of data complexity, namely the algorithmic information content. In general this measure, also known as Kolmogorov complexity, represents the compressibility of the data strings. It can also be used to describe properties (linear and nonlinear) of the underlying dynamical system.

Its descriptive parameters are entirely based on time, but they can be derived also from the statistical moments of the power spectrum. Thus the method provides a bridge between a physical time domain interpretation and the conventional frequency domain description. Further, the parameters are based on the concept of variance, giving them an additive property so that the measured values pertain also to any basic elements from which a complex curve may be composed by superposition.

The proposed method offers a way to on-line measurement of basic signal properties by means of a time-based calculation, requiring less complex equipment compared to conventional frequency analysis. The data-reducing capability of the parameters has been experimentally stated in the recording of “sleep profiles”.},

	abstract = {Analysis of electroencephalographic ({EEG}) signals usually includes visual inspection of the signal, feature extraction, and model generation. Computer-aided nonlinear feature extraction from {EEG} in particular has already led to improved descriptive and prognostic models of brain states and disorders. However, in this field, there is a lack of freely available powerful tools for scientific exploration of {EEG} that would help researchers to compare the results of their work with others. Especially, because of the great diversity of the proposed methods for {EEG} analysis, there exists a need for a joint framework for inspection, extraction and visualization performed on the {EEG} records. The aim of this paper is to introduce such a framework, called {EEGFrame}, with its implementation in Java. The framework currently supports the analysis of standard {EDF} records via signal inspection, feature extraction, and feature vectors storage for knowledge discovery. {EEGFrame} is the result of refactoring and extension of the {HRVFrame} framework for heart rate variability analysis, with added methods for {EEG} analysis. This paper describes the properties and capabilities of the framework and discusses its relevance with respect to similar work. The main advantage of {EEGFrame} is its support for numerous linear and nonlinear methods described in literature.},

We describe in detail the basis and implementation of the multiscale entropy ({MSE}) method. We extend and elaborate previous findings showing its applicability to the fluctuations of the human heartbeat under physiologic and pathologic conditions. The method consistently indicates a loss of complexity with aging, with an erratic cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation), and with a life-threatening syndrome (congestive heart failure). Further, these different conditions have distinct {MSE} curve profiles, suggesting diagnostic uses. The results support a general “complexity-loss” theory of aging and disease. We also apply the method to the analysis of coding and noncoding {DNA} sequences and find that the latter have higher multiscale entropy, consistent with the emerging view that so-called “junk {DNA}” sequences contain important biological information.},

Pincus introduced approximate entropy ({ApEn}), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. {ApEn} statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy ({SampEn}), and have compared {ApEn} and {SampEn} by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-{ApEn} and cross-{SampEn}, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. {SampEn} agreed with theory much more closely than {ApEn} over a broad range of conditions. The improved accuracy of {SampEn} statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.},

	abstract = {{TASK} channels are acid-sensitive and anesthetic-activated members of the family of two-pore-domain potassium channels. We have made the surprising discovery that the genetic ablation of {TASK}-3 channels eliminates a specific type of theta oscillation in the cortical electroencephalogram ({EEG}) resembling type {II} theta (4–9 Hz), which is thought to be important in processing sensory stimuli before initiating motor activity. In contrast, ablation of {TASK}-1 channels has no effect on theta oscillations. Despite the absence of type {II} theta oscillations in the {TASK}-3 knockout ({KO}) mice, the related type I theta, which has certain neuronal pathways in common and is involved in exploratory behavior, is unaffected. In addition to the absence of type {II} theta oscillations, the {TASK}-3 {KO} animals show marked alterations in both anesthetic sensitivity and natural sleep behavior. Their sensitivity to halothane, a potent activator of {TASK} channels, is greatly reduced, whereas their sensitivity to cyclopropane, which does not activate {TASK}-3 channels, is unchanged. The {TASK}-3 {KO} animals exhibit a slower progression from their waking to sleeping states and, during their sleeping period, their sleep episodes as well as their {REM} theta oscillations are more fragmented. These results imply a previously unexpected role for {TASK}-3 channels in the cellular mechanisms underlying these behaviors and suggest that endogenous modulators of these channels may regulate theta oscillations.},

This paper presents Julia, a new dynamic language for technical computing, designed for performance from the beginning by adapting and extending modern programming language techniques. A design based on generic functions and a rich type system simultaneously enables an expressive programming model and successful type inference, leading to good performance for a wide range of programs. This makes it possible for much of the Julia library to be written in Julia itself, while also incorporating best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries.},

The electroencephalogram ({EEG}) is a representative signal containing information about the condition of the brain. The shape of the wave may contain useful information about the state of the brain. However, the human observer cannot directly monitor these subtle details. Besides, since bio-signals are highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale. Therefore, the {EEG} signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. The aim of this work is to compare the different entropy estimators when applied to {EEG} data from normal and epileptic subjects. The results obtained indicate that entropy estimators can distinguish normal and epileptic {EEG} data with more than 95\% confidence (using t-test). The classification ability of the entropy measures is tested using {ANFIS} classifier. The results are promising and a classification accuracy of about 90\% is achieved.},

The long-term {EEG} recordings of an epileptic patient obtained from the ambulatory recording systems contain a large volume of {EEG} data. Detection of the epileptic activity requires a time consuming analysis of the entire length of the {EEG} data by an expert. The traditional methods of analysis being tedious, many automated diagnostic systems for epilepsy have emerged in recent years. This paper discusses an automated diagnostic method for epileptic detection using a special type of recurrent neural network known as Elman network. The experiments are carried out by using time-domain as well as frequency-domain features of the {EEG} signal. Experimental results show that Elman network yields epileptic detection accuracy rates as high as 99.6\% with a single input feature which is better than the results obtained by using other types of neural networks with two and more input features.},

	abstract = {{SummaryObjective}
In this paper, electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals of 20 schizophrenic patients and 20 age-matched control participants are analyzed with the objective of classifying the two groups.
Materials and methods
For each case, 20 channels of {EEG} are recorded. Several features including Shannon entropy, spectral entropy, approximate entropy, Lempel–Ziv complexity and Higuchi fractal dimension are extracted from {EEG} signals. Leave-one (participant)-out cross-validation is used for reliable estimate of the separability of the two groups. The training set is used for training the two classifiers, namely, linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}) and adaptive boosting (Adaboost). Each classifier is assessed using the test dataset.
Results
A classification accuracy of 86\% and 90\% is obtained by {LDA} and Adaboost respectively. For further improvement, genetic programming is employed to select the best features and remove the redundant ones. Applying the two classifiers to the reduced feature set, a classification accuracy of 89\% and 91\% is obtained by {LDA} and Adaboost respectively. The proposed technique is compared and contrasted with a recently reported method and it is demonstrated that a considerably enhanced performance is achieved.
Conclusion
This study shows that {EEG} signals can be a useful tool for discrimination of the schizophrenic and control participants. It is suggested that this analysis can be a complementary tool to help psychiatrists diagnosing schizophrenic patients.},

Currently, scoring is slow, biased and prone to error by humans and thus is the most important bottleneck for large-scale sleep research in animals. We have developed an unsupervised, fully automated sleep staging method for mice that allows less subjective and high-throughput evaluation of sleep. Fully Automated Sleep {sTaging} method via {EEG}/{EMG} Recordings ({FASTER}) is based on nonparametric density estimation clustering of comprehensive {EEG}/{EMG} power spectra. {FASTER} can accurately identify sleep patterns in mice that have been perturbed by drugs or by genetic modification of a clock gene. The overall accuracy is over 90\% in every group. 24-h data are staged by a laptop computer in 10 min, which is faster than an experienced human rater. Dramatically improving the sleep staging process in both quality and throughput {FASTER} will open the door to quantitative and comprehensive animal sleep research.},

To identify different vigilance states, even a well-trained expert must spend a lot of time analyzing a mass of physiological recording data. This study proposes an automatic vigilance stages classification method for analyzing {EEG} signals in rats. The {EEG} signals were transferred by fast Fourier transform before extracting features. These extracted features were then used as training patterns to construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two functional units. The first unit is principle component analysis ({PCA}) method, which is used to project the high dimensional features into the lower dimensional subspace. The second unit is the k-nearest neighbor (k-{NN}) method, which identifies the physiological state in each {EEG} signal epoch. Based on the results of analyzing 810 epochs of {EEG} signal, the proposed classification method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy for vigilance states. Based on machine-learning algorithms, the classifier learns to approach the configuration that best fits the categorization task. Therefore, additional training in searching best parameters and thresholds can be avoided. Moreover, the {PCA} algorithm projects data instances into a 3-D space, making it possible to visualize state-changing dynamics. Experimental results show that the proposed machine-learning based classifier performs better than conventional vigilance state classification algorithms. The results also suggest that it is possible to identify the vigilance states with only {EEG} signals using the proposed pattern recognition technique.},

	abstract = {The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises. (author´s abstract)},

	abstract = {To study the neurophysiology of large-scale spatial cognition, we analyzed the neuronal activity of navigating homing pigeons. This is not possible using conventional radio-telemetry suitable for short distances only. Therefore we developed a miniaturized data logger (“neurologger”) that can be carried by a homing pigeon on its back, in conjunction with a micro-global position system ({GPS}) logger recording the spatial position of the bird. In its present state, the neurologger permits recording from up to eight single-ended or differential electrodes in a walking or flying pigeon. Inputs from eight independent channels are preamplified, band-pass filtered, and directed to an eight-channel, 10-bit analog-digital converter of the microcontroller storing data on a “Multimedia” or “Secure Digital” card. For electroencephalography ({EEG}), the logger permits simultaneous recordings of up to eight channels during maximally 47 h, depending on memory, while single unit activity from two channels can be stored over 9 h. The logger permits single unit separation from recorded multiunit signals. The neurologger with {GPS} represents a better alternative to telemetry that will eventually permit to record neuronal activity during cognitive and innate behavior of many species moving freely in their habitats but will also permit automated high-throughput screening of {EEG} in the laboratory.},

Across mammals, the amount and nature of sleep are correlated with age, body size and ecological variables, such as whether the animals live in a terrestrial or an aquatic environment, their diet and the safety of their sleeping site. Sleep may be an efficient time for the completion of a number of functions, but variations in sleep expression indicate that these functions may differ across species.},

Animal studies have shown that interactions between immune signalling molecules (such as the cytokine interleukin 1) and brain neurochemical systems (such as the serotonin system) are amplified during infection, indicating that these interactions might underlie the changes in sleep that occur during infection. Why should the immune system cause us to sleep differently when we are sick? We propose that the alterations in sleep architecture during infection are exquisitely tailored to support the generation of fever, which in turn imparts survival value.},

These vulnerable time periods coincided with polygraphically observed {PS} increases above normal levels following identical training procedures in previous studies. In Experiment 2, animals were only allowed {PS} during the 9–12 hour and 17–20 hour post training time “windows” observed in Experiment 1. For the remaining time each day, they were subjected to {PSD}. Acquisition was found to be unimparied, despite this severe treatment. However, any other equivalent length {PSD} regime which overlapped with either of the time “windows” resulted in severe retardation of task acquisition.

Sleep is a complex physiologic process that is influenced by many internal and environmental factors, and problems with sleep are often related to specific personal circumstances or are based on subjective reports from the affected person. Although human subjects are used widely in the study of sleep and sleep disorders, the study of animals has been invaluable in developing our understanding about the physiology of sleep and the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders. Historically, the use of animals for the study of sleep disorders has arguably been most fruitful for the condition of narcolepsy, in which studies of dogs and mice revealed previously unsuspected mechanisms for this condition. The current overview considers animal models that have been used to study 4 of the most common human sleep disorders—insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea—and summarizes considerations relevant to the use of animals for the study of sleep and sleep disorders. Animal-based research has been vital to the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie sleep, its regulation, and its disorders and undoubtedly will remain crucial for discovering and validating sleep mechanisms and testing interventions for sleep disorders.},

An {EEG} parameter is derived which is based on the joint frequency-amplitude distribution of the {EEG} activity. This newly developed parameter stresses the dynamic development of sleep, composed of alternating phases of {EEG} synchronization and desynchronization. While synchronization develops slowly, the opposite phase of {EEG} activity, desynchronization, is more rapid. A particular advantage of the {EEG} parameter is its continuous scale which results in high resolution. Thus, the parameter reflects gradual {EEG} changes which a visual analyser would have to classify into the same sleep stage. In addition to the {EEG}, the {EMG} is analysed and two parameters are extracted, representing the mean muscle tone and transient {EMG} activation, respectively. There is a close temporal relationship between the {EEG} and the {EMG} with a maximum of transient {EMG} activity during the phase of {EEG} desynchronization. The properties of the automatic analysis were compared to the visual analysis on a sample of 12 all-night sleep records. The results show that the {EEG} parameter also agrees sufficiently with the traditional sleep scoring method and therefore is a valid descriptor of the time course of sleep.},

Despite extensive use of connectionist models in biological data processing, in the past, the field of sleep research appeared to have neglected this approach. Only a few sleep-wake staging systems based on neural network technology have been developed. This paper reviews the current use of artificial neural networks in sleep research. Following a brief presentation of neural network technology, each of the existing system is described and attention drawn to the heterogeneity of the different processing approaches in sleep research.

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

	abstract = {The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises. (author´s abstract)},

Alongside this issue, benchmarking, and the development of fair, and widely available benchmark sets present another barrier. In this paper, we outline several suggestions to address these issues, driven by specific examples from a range of scientific domains.

This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.

Traditional methods for gene selection in classification problems have several drawbacks. First, the majority of the gene selection approaches for classification are single-gene based. Second, many of the gene selection procedures are not embedded within the algorithm itself. The technique of random forests has been found to perform well in high dimensional data settings with survival outcomes. It also has an embedded feature to identify variables of importance. Therefore, it is an ideal candidate for gene selection in high dimensional data with survival outcomes. In this paper, we develop a novel method based on the random forests to identify a set of prognostic genes. We compare our method with several machine learning methods and various node split criteria using several real data sets. Our method performed well in both simulations and real data analysis. Additionally, we have shown the advantages of our approach over single-gene based approaches. Our method incorporates multivariate correlations in microarray data for survival outcomes. The described method allows us to best utilize the information available from microarray data with survival outcomes.},

The random forest classifier with its associated Gini feature importance, on the other hand, allows for an explicit feature elimination, but may not be optimally adapted to spectral data due to the topology of its constituent classification trees which are based on orthogonal splits in feature space. Results We propose to combine the best of both approaches, and evaluated the joint use of a feature selection based on a recursive feature elimination using the Gini importance of random forests' together with regularized classification methods on spectral data sets from medical diagnostics, chemotaxonomy, biomedical analytics, food science, and synthetically modified spectral data. Here, a feature selection using the Gini feature importance with a regularized classification by discriminant partial least squares regression performed as well as or better than a filtering according to different univariate statistical tests, or using regression coefficients in a backward feature elimination. It outperformed the direct application of the random forest classifier, or the direct application of the regularized classifiers on the full set of features. Conclusion The Gini importance of the random forest provided superior means for measuring feature relevance on spectral data, but – on an optimal subset of features – the regularized classifiers might be preferable over the random forest classifier, in spite of their limitation to model linear dependencies only. A feature selection based on Gini importance, however, may precede a regularized linear classification to identify this optimal subset of features, and to earn a double benefit of both dimensionality reduction and the elimination of noise from the classification task.},

The feasibility of applying {SVM} in financial forecasting is first examined by comparing it with the multilayer back-propagation ({BP}) neural network and the regularized radial basis function ({RBF}) neural network. The variability in performance of {SVM} with respect to the free parameters is investigated experimentally. Adaptive parameters are then proposed by incorporating the nonstationarity of financial time series into {SVM}. Five real futures contracts collated from the Chicago Mercantile Market are used as the data sets. The simulation shows that among the three methods, {SVM} outperforms the {BP} neural network in financial forecasting, and there are comparable generalization performance between {SVM} and the regularized {RBF} neural network. Furthermore, the free parameters of {SVM} have a great effect on the generalization performance. {SVM} with adaptive parameters can both achieve higher generalization performance and use fewer support vectors than the standard {SVM} in financial forecasting.},

	abstract = {The classification of sleep–wake stages suffers from poor standardization in scoring criteria and heterogeneous conditioning of polysomnographic signals. To improve applicability of fully automated sleep staging, we have designed a formal classification framework to rigorously (1) select robust candidate features, (2) emulate artificial neural network classifiers, and (3) assign sleep–wake stages using flexible decision rules. An extensive database of 48 {PSG} records scored in 20 s epochs by two independent clinicians was used. A small subset of 2 s elementary epochs representative of each stages with unequivocal expert scores was selected to form a limited set of learning exemplars. From 16 statistical, spectral and non-linear candidate features extracted in 2 s epochs from {EEG} and {EMG} signals, a sequential forward search selected an optimal set of five features with a 22\% error rate. Multiple layer perceptrons were trained from this optimal feature set while classification accuracy was assessed using the unequivocal instance subset. A simple majority vote among 10 consecutive classifier outputs ensured a final scoring resolution comparable to that of the experts. Poor classification performance was obtained for movement time, wakefulness, and intermediate sleep stages with a 36±15\% error rate (Cohen's kappa 0.48±0.18). In contrast, deep and paradoxical sleep was classified with an 82\% accuracy not far from inter-expert expert agreement (83±3\%). Significant improvements should be expected using a larger learning set compensating for a high inter-individual variability, and decision rules incorporating more domain-knowledge.

	abstract = {Currently in the world there is an alarming number of people who suffer from sleep disorders. A number of biomedical signals, such as {EEG}, {EMG}, {ECG} and {EOG} are used in sleep labs among others for diagnosis and treatment of sleep related disorders. The usual method for sleep stage classification is visual inspection by a sleep specialist. This is a very time consuming and laborious exercise. Automatic sleep stage classification can facilitate this process. The definition of sleep stages and the sleep literature show that {EEG} signals are similar in Stage1 of non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep. Therefore, in this work an attempt was made to classify four sleep stages consisting of Awake, Stage1 + {REM}, Stage 2 and Slow Wave Stage based on the {EEG} signal alone. Wavelet packet coefficients and artificial neural networks were deployed for this purpose. Seven all night recordings from Physionet database were used in the study. The results demonstrated that these four sleep stages could be automatically discriminated from each other with a specificity of 94.4 ± 4.5\%, a of sensitivity 84.2+3.9\% and an accuracy of 93.0 ± 4.0\%.},
