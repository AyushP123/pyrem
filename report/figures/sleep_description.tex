  \textbf{A}: Characteristics of the three vigilance states: \gls{nrem}, \gls{rem} and wakefulness.
  Typically, frequency and amplitude of the \acrfull{eeg}, and amplitude of the \acrfull{emg} are used by experts to infer vigilance state.
  The frequency ranges and prevalences are approximate values for healthy adult animals in normal conditions.
  Each wave shows a representative five second epoch with high signal to noise ratio.
  \textbf{B}: Empirical transition probabilities between consecutive five second epochs. 
  The width of the arrow is proportional to transition probability.
  Values have been computed from the 12 recordings used in this study.
  Probabilities of remaining in each state are implied.
