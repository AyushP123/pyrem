  \textbf{A}: Characteristics of the three vigilance states: \gls{nrem}, \gls{rem} and wakefulness.
  Typically, frequency and amplitude of the \acrfull{eeg}, and amplitude of the \acrfull{emg} are used by experts to infer vigilance state.
  The frequency ranges and prevalences are approximate values for healthy adult animals in normal conditions.
  Each wave shows a representative five second epoch with high signal to noise ratio.
  \textbf{B}: Empirical transition probabilities between consecutive five second epochs. The width of the arrow is proportional to transition probability.
  Probabilities of remaining in the three state are implied.
