  In order to improve prediction accuracy, information about the past and future features was added to the original features following two different strategies.
  Convolution inflates $p$ by adding the mean features of neighbour points over different window sizes (eq.~\ref{eq:window}).
  The numbers in braces represent the window sizes. 
  Alternatively, the features of the $\tau$ previous and future neighbours was added to the variables (eq.~\ref{eq:tau}).
  The dotted line reprents a cross-validation error of $10\%$
