\section{Discussion} \label{discussion}

\subsection{python package} 
Clear improvement over existing software.

Faster, less math mistake

more features.

Independant from sleep, so can be used fort other stuff

why sample entropy and ap entropy do not as well...

julia link

public relase of this package


\subsection{Originality of feature extraction} 
Feature extraction is more exhaustive.
it turns out that some wavelet specific features were  important predictor
include temporal features.
why is that controvertial => sleep is assumed to be consistant

\subsection{Using random forest} 

* Variable importance (investigation ++)

* white box

* General classifier, so we can use the exact same data and something like ANN

* Efficient

* natural inclusion of non linearity, which is expected when we get more data

\subsection{Originality of crossvalidation} 

Very conservative
