\subsection{\texttt{Python} package}
Speed Improvement. correction of math formulae.

\input{./tables/benchmark}
Interface imporvement (see package doc)

Visualisation (explain why it is important)

\subsection{DWT, feature extraction strategy}
Explain typycal approach, and why using DWT and then epoching is advantageaous while remaing fast.

\subsection{Important features}
$n$ is large, reducing $p$ could make the analysis faster. computing each $p$ feature is slow.
variable importance can be used to select a subset of informative variable.

20ish variable are good enough.

The analysis can be rendered faster
\subsection{Including temporal information}
Using features at $\mathbf{Z} = \{\mathbf{X_{t-\tau}}, ..., \mathbf{X_{t}}, ..., \mathbf{X_{t+\tau}}\}$ provide a significant improvement over $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X_{t}}$.

It does not seem adventageous to use $\tau > 3$.
\subsection{Deeper assesment}
