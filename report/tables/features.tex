\caption{\ctit{List of computed features.}
For clarity, the 16 calculated features were classified into four functional families.
For all epochs, all features were computed on all wavelet coefficients and raw (\gls{eeg} and \gls{emg}) signals. Therefore, a total of
$16 \times (1+7 + 1 + 3) = 192$ features were generated for each five seconds of recording.
The mathematical detail of the algorithms is provided in the documentation of \pr{} (see appendix).
