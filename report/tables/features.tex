\caption{\ctit{List of features.}
For clarity, features were classified in four functionnal families.
16 scalar features, in four families, are computed for each epoch.
Since all features are computed for all wavelet coefficients and raw signals (\gls{eeg} and \gls{emg}), a total of 
$16 \times (1+7 + 1 + 3) = 192$ features are generated every five secon of recording.
The mathematical detail of the algorithms is provided in the documentation of \pr{} (see appendix).
