\subsection{Data}
\subsection{Preprocessing}

First of all, \gls{EEG} and \gls{EMG} signals were resampled from approximatly 200.0Hz to 256.0Hz using
conservative sinc interpolation\citationneeded{Putman}. 
256.0Hz was prefered to 200.0Hz because
Annotations labels were resampled at 0.20Hz using nearest neghbour interpolation.



\subsection{Stratified Cross Validation}
why this is super important


\subsection{Random forests}
mtry, n-tree, entropy-based confidence.
\subsection{Statistics}
